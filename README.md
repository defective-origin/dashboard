# Dashboard Web Application

Allows users to create boards which show different widgets.

The main task of our application is a convenient, fast and independent display of data.
All you need to display them is to use ready-made widgets, boards and APIs by connecting them or implementing your own and registering them.

1) Independence of parts - API, widget, metrics collection (on its side)
2) Security - I donâ€™t know anything about you and your data
3) Easy to use - Managing widgets, boards, settings
